DayLine is an Android app that provides a homescreen widget to visualize Calendar events on a timeline.
It uses Google Calendar as a source of events.

##Functionality
#####Events
Events are provided by Google Calendar - you can add and modify them there.
#####Size and shape
Widget is dynamically resizable, so you should adjust it to your preferences after placing.
#####Colors
Colors, as for now, are taken from CalendarProvider directly, so they match event colors as they were in "old" Calendar.

###Planned and possible features

* **More color options** - like in new Calendar, random, custom pallets.
* **'Inverted' labels** - on rectangular background
* **Horizontal timeline for landscape screens**
* **More frequent updates of widget**
* **Showing the past** - current time indicator moving through timeline.
